# Advice generator

This is a solution to the Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor --(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). 

The main motivation behind this project is to create design as proximate to given design.

This project basically focuses on fetch and handling of promises in javaScript.
Here the challenge was to get the data by using fetch and make necessary changes in the DOM to 
display the same.
After each click a new call has to be made to show new content.

The following has to be incorporated to complete this project--
1- HTML structring
2-CSS styling
3-Responsive desgin
4-DOM manipulation
5-fetch 
6-Promise handling 
7-Use of then and catch
